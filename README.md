myPythonFunctions.py is currently unused, but is a functional hi-score table saved to a text file. It uses forceOpen.py to create files if they don't exist, when they are called to be opened.

In its current state, mathGame.py will give you five numbers and four operands to solve, then check your answer against the computer's. Future iterations will make use of the hi-score functions of myPythonFunctions.py.
